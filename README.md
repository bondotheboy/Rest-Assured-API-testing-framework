# Rest-Assured-API-testing-framework
A TestNG framework for automating a dummy Rest Assured API. The code actually tests various POST requests directed towards two endpoints.

You can run the complete test suite in 2 ways

1. Open command prompt at your project location (where pom.xml is located), and type 
  "mvn clean test"

Once the tests are run, test report would be generated at " /target/surefire-reports/emailable-report.html"

2. Import the project in your IDE, refresh maven dependencies. Select the TestNG.xml, and run it as a TestNG suite.

Once the tests are run, test report would be generated at " /test-output/emailable-report.html"
